# **Computational Geometry: Part A**

## Introduction
<p class="justify">
Implementing algorithms in Python from scratch for computing convex hull of points. Every algorithm is tested extensively in different inputs including edge cases. The correcteness of the implementation of each algorithm is checked by comparing the results with the ones of the brute-force sub-optimal solution. Moreover, the user can execute each algorithm and examine the results from the plot of the convex hull, along with the rest of the points, that is created. For "Graham Scan's" algorithm step-by-step visuals are also provided. Lastly, all algorithms are tested under the same cases and a comparison table of their performance is provided.
